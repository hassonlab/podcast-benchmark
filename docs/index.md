# Podcast Benchmark Documentation

A benchmarking framework for neural decoding from podcast listening data. 

## Decoding Tasks

1. **Brain --> perceived word decoding** Translate brain signals to perceived words, comparing performance to [previously published results](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01026-4).
2. **Audio Reconstruction** Reconstruct podcast audio envelope from brain signal (Regression)
3. **Sentence Onset Detection** Classify (binary) segments of brain data as containing the beginning of a sentence or not
4. **Content/Non-Content Words Classification** (Binary classification)
5. **Part of Speech Classification** (Multiclass classification)
6. **LLM Surprise** Predict how likely the perceived word is given it's context (Regression)

## Overview

This framework provides a flexible system for:
- Training neural decoding models on iEEG data
- Comparing different model architectures
- Evaluating performance across multiple metrics
- Running systematic hyperparameter searches
